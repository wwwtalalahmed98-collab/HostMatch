"""Proteome budget arithmetic for the universal chassis question.

Asks: can one cell carry all 37 capabilities at once?

All input numbers are measured values from the literature, cited in
protocol/proteome-budget-v1.md. Nothing here is fitted or assumed except
the per-capability cost, which is swept across a plausible range because
nobody has measured it.
